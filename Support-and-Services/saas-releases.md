## July 12th
Platform Update

* Fixed an issue where a user invited to a stopped database will wrongly see the "Creating" state, although the database is actually stopped.
* Fixed an issue where the REST API cluster status could sometimes return "Running" state too early, although the database is not completely ready to be used. This was also inconsistent with the databases state.

UI Update
* We introduced a new preview feature "schema browser for Worksheets". You can now browse your database schemas, tables and other metadata using the schema browser, available in the left side bar on the worksheet page. Following objects are supported:
  - Schemas, separated by user schemas, system schemas and virtual schemas
  - Tables, Views, and columns with type information
  - Users and roles
  - UDFs
  - Virtual Schema Adapters
  - Lua Scripts
  - Functions

## June 21st
Platform Update
* The speed of database creation was improved, so in most cases it is expected to take less than 5 minutes.
* Fixed wrong prices shown in the UI when creating a database or cluster, where some prices were not consistent with the prices shown on https://www.exasol.com/exasol-saas/.

Database Update
* Fix IMPORT FROM JDBC, which is currently failing in some cases. (Sometimes restarting the database fixes the problem)
* Note: The new version is only effective for new databases. Please contact support for updating existing databases.


## June 8th
UI Update
* Improved SQL worksheets to keep the focus in the SQL editor after running a statement, to enable running interactive SQL statements with keyboard only. Before the keyboard focus changed to the result set.
* Minor improvement to names of Personal Access Tokens which are autogenerated in the "Connect via tool" wizard. So far the PAT name included the cluster name, wrongly indicating that the PAT is bound to a cluster.
